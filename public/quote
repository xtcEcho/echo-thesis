I tend to like to shave, but sometimes letting my body hair grow out is what makes me feel sexy.

Hell, I’m also positive that many of the ways I continue to be “sexy” are heavily influenced by misogyny. But it feels good to me, and it’s my damn choice, right? Isn’t that what feminism is about—choice?

 -- No matter what you do, including choosing to model nude, it's a feminist act as long as it feels right. Because feminism is all about choice

the fact that my body was at all visible had somehow discredited me and my political action. 

 -- the innate power that female sexuality possesses. A woman becomes too powerful and thus threatening when she takes strength from embracing her sex.

 -- Give women the opportunity to be whatever they want and as multifaceted as they can be.

 -- Nude modeling is another opportunity for women to exercise their ability to choose—a choice based on how they want to look like and how they want to be seen and perceived.

 -- As long as the decision is my choice, then it’s the right choice. 

 -- Feminism means to be whatever women want to be, without being questioned or discriminated based on gender. It's fine to be strong, it's fine to speak out for yourself, it's fine to be feminine, it's fine to challenge whatever status quo is laid out for you without fear of consequence. And it's also fine to pose for nude.
